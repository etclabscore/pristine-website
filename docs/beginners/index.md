# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome!

New to Pristine? Youâ€™re in the right place. Letâ€™s start with the big picture.

Pristine is an open source repository in its original condition.

It is a starting point that follows a Documentation Driven Development approach and can be used as a resource to create new projects or augment existing ones.

Using conventions, documentation and specifications within your project make it easier to:

- Communicate the problem you are solving
- Ease project onboarding
- build and use composable tools
- promote open source contribution and engagement
- promite issue and feature discussion on Github itself

**Right now, developers all over the world are building projects that take advantage of Pristine, inventing new kinds of applications and patterns, many of which can be rolled back into a new Pristine project:**

**Welcome to pristine.builders.**
