# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome!

New to Jade? Youâ€™re in the right place. Letâ€™s start with the big picture.

The Jade suite of tools empowers developers to create peer-to-peer decentralized applications on top of EVM-based blockchains like Ethereum Classic.

Jades tooling has a few goals we believe are essential for any mission critical application:

- Users should be in control of thier account
    - This draws fine lines between where private keys are stored, how transactions are signed, and how they are broadcast.
- Uniformly Documented Interfaces
    - Leveraging the [OpenRPC Specification](https://open-rpc.org) to provide a documentation driven suite of tools
- Developers should have an easy way of deploying the entire stack of their application
    - Reduces the barrier to entry 
- Applications should be able to run almost anywhere. Browser, smartphones, Native Desktop, etc...
- Users should have the option to choose a security model that fits themselves not the application developer.

To maximize the quality of our open sourcce software, Jade projects follow our [Pristine](https://github.com/etclabscore/pristine) open standard to ensure high quality contributions, documentation driven development philosphy, and reduce variance to improve re-use across projects.


## The Structure of a Truly P2P Application

Jade is broken down into layers to make it easier to explain, document, consume, and develop for:

**Right now, thousands of developers all over the world are building protocols that use JSON-RPC, and inventing new kinds of applications, many of which can benefit from Jade today:**
